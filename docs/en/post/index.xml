      <description>&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t much info on Cocos2d-x but that&amp;rsquo;s enough to understand main ideas. The problem is the framework is old so some things rendered obsolete. You&amp;rsquo;ll have to constantly compare the articles and the real life implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description>
