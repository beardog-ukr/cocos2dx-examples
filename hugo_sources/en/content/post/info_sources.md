There isn't much info on Cocos2d-x but that's enough to understand main ideas. The problem is the framework is old so some things rendered obsolete. You'll have to constantly compare the articles and the real life implementation.

Official documentation:
* [Guide](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/cocos2d-x/v4/en/).
* [Code documentation](https://docs.cocos2d-x.org/api-ref/cplusplus/v4x/)
* [Forum](https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/), There are [some](https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/cocos3-0-tutorial-game-catchme/14258) [tutorials](https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/tutorials-collection-from-this-forum/14567) there but they are mostly obsolete now.
* [Functional tests](https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/tree/v4/tests/cpp-tests/Classes); the framework developers see it as a demonstration of how everything should be used. You may often get "check in the tests" answer on the forum.

Also there are some series of posts:

* [rezghob.com](https://rezghob.com/category/rts/) — probably the most recent.
